# Novelist — Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview

Novelist is a lightweight, WYSIWYG Markdown desktop writing app built
with **Tauri v2 + Svelte 5 + Rust + CodeMirror 6**. Target: novelists
who need a fast, CJK-aware editor with plugin support.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 (Runes: `$state`, `$derived`), Tailwind CSS 4, Vite 6
- **Editor**: CodeMirror 6 with custom WYSIWYG decorations
- **Backend**: Rust (Tauri v2), Tokio async runtime
- **IPC**: tauri-specta (auto-generates TypeScript bindings from Rust)
- **Plugin sandbox**: QuickJS via rquickjs
- **Large files**: Ropey rope data structure
- **File watching**: Notify (FSEvent on macOS)
- **Export**: Pandoc (external binary)

## Development Commands

```bash
pnpm install          # Install frontend deps
pnpm tauri dev        # Start dev server + Tauri window
pnpm tauri build      # Production build
pnpm check            # Svelte type checking

# Testing
pnpm test             # Frontend unit tests (vitest, ~1s)
pnpm test:e2e:browser # Browser E2E (Playwright + mocked IPC, ~5s)
pnpm test:e2e:ui      # Playwright interactive UI mode
pnpm test:e2e:debug   # Playwright with step-through debugger
pnpm test:rust        # Backend tests (cargo test in core/)
pnpm test:all         # Unit + Rust tests
```

## Critical Rules

- **`app/lib/ipc/commands.ts` is auto-generated** from Rust via
  tauri-specta — never edit by hand. Re-run `pnpm tauri dev` after
  changing any `#[tauri::command]`.
- **`app/lib/app-commands.ts` is the sole `commandRegistry.register`
  site.** Command palette and global keyboard router both dispatch
  through `commandRegistry.execute()`. Don't reintroduce a parallel
  `shortcutHandlers` map.
- **Atomic file writes** (temp file + rename) for all user data.
- **CJK text support is non-negotiable** — always consider CJK in word
  counting, IME handling, and layout.
- **File watcher uses BLAKE3 hashing** with self-write suppression — see
  [docs/design-docs/file-lifecycle.md](docs/design-docs/file-lifecycle.md).
- Plugins (canvas, mindmap, kanban) and the template panel are **core
  product features** — no hiding or demoting.

## Design Philosophy

**"Prompt as UI"**: Novelist is designed to be customized by AI coding
assistants editing the source directly, rather than through complex
configuration UIs. Keep the desktop app kernel lean — no HTTP API calls
or AI model integrations in the binary.

## Module Layout (post 2026-04-20 refactor)

- `app/lib/stores/*.svelte.ts` — rune stores (one per domain)
- `app/lib/composables/*.svelte.ts` — component-init hooks (own
  `$state`/`$effect`, exposed as `createX` / `useX` / `wireX`)
- `app/lib/services/*.ts` — IPC orchestration, no reactive state
- `app/lib/utils/*.ts` — pure TS helpers
- `app/lib/editor/*.ts` — CodeMirror 6 extensions + pure view helpers
- `app/lib/components/*.svelte` — Svelte 5 components
- `core/src/commands/` — one file per domain; all return
  `Result<T, AppError>` (see `core/src/error.rs`)
- `core/src/services/` — file watcher, rope, plugin host
- `core/src/models/` — data structures with serde + specta derives

## Recent Notable Additions

See `git log` for full history. Recent highlights (2026-04):

- App.svelte refactor (1475 → ~741 lines); composables + services split.
- Template files panel with bundled defaults + `$|$` caret anchor.
- Settings two-tier overlay (global + per-project) on Rust side.
- Startup instrumentation (`log_startup_phase` + `startup-timing.ts`),
  lazy QuickJS runtime, async recent-projects cleanup.
- Canvas / kanban file-type editors (native, not plugin-shimmed).
- `Cmd+Shift+M` move-file palette; sidebar + editor context menus.
- Smart project-mode new-file naming with H1 auto-rename.
- Numeric-aware sidebar sort (第二章 < 第十章).
